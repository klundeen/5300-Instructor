# 5300-Instructor
Instructor's DB Relation Manager project for CPSC5300 at Seattle U, Winter Quarter 2024

Usage (argument is database directory):
<pre>
$ ./sql5300 ~/cpsc5300/data
</pre>

The database directory must exist, but needn't have any contents. Running sql5300 the first time will initialize it.

## Tags
- <code>Milestone1_prep</code> is just some bare bones stuff to get students started on Milestone 1.
- <code>Milestone2h</code> has the intructor-provided files for Milestone2. (Note that heap_storage.cpp is just a stub.)
